Trello's bad, txt ftw

Ideas:
1. Create an initial training step that shows the NN legal and illegal moves
2. Separate black and white pieces into separate neurons - Instead of 1 for white and -1 for black
3. Add a minmax process after the NN to modify the output of the top recommended moves - Slightly cheaty because it isn't a pure Neural Net anymore
4. Apply Reward function v1 for a certain percentage of moves, training long memory handles it

Todo:
1. Verify all the moves
2. Reward Function (Piece Positions / Taking Pieces / Losing Pieces)
3. Save Model
